This project is to illustrate testing principles. 
Using the Mocha test framework and assert methods from the Node.js standard library, 
I tested the methods of an object implementation.

I also separated the test into Setup, Exercise, and Verify phases. 
This distinct makes the test more reliable, maintainable, and expressive.

To run the test suite please run the following command: npm run test
